//AJAX - not a language or framework but a set of technologies to send and receive data asynchronously
//now JSON has taken place of xml as javascript object notation as its easier, faster and popular. 
//updating small parts of webpage can be done with vanilla js or with external libraries like jquery or an http library like axios
//server returns data in the form of json or xml or plain text and done using xmlhttprequest object
//the object is an api in the form of an object, it has properties and methods
//can also work with other protocols than http, the methods transfer data between client/server
/* other methods to make ajax calls other than plain js ->
1. jquery - a dom manipulation library - much more than ajax
2. axios
3. superagent - 2. and 3. are slim libraries to make http requests
4. fetch api
5. prototype
6. node http - node js
